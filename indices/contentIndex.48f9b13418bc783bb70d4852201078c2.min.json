Now that I am wrapping\n\u003e the final few classes (possibly of my entire life), it might be a good time \n\u003e to recap and put a tie on the past few years of my studies and life. Plus, \n\u003e this is the perfect way for me to procrastinate on my thesis üôà.\n\n# Overview\nLess than two years ago, I accepted my offer to pursue graduate studies at UIUC.\nLooking back, the past one and a half years were some of my most defining times\nand changed my perspective on many things in my life. Some of my experiences\nhave drastically changed how I view my life moving forward, both personal and professional.\n\nThe next two months will also most likily be my final two months ever in school. \nThis post is also a goodbye to my love-hate relationship with the education system.\n\n# Motivations\nAs mentioned in my previous post, doing a Masters was a good \nway to determine whether a PhD was something I would pursue. It turns out,\nthe answer was no. There are a variety of factors into why I decided on this.\n\n\nAlthough üí∏ is definetly a major factor in my decision, I think at a certain point,\nI was finally burnt out of school. Work will definetly still be stressful but after\n18(ish) years of school, the routine finally got to me. One thing I have to highlight\nhowever is that a Masters Program can be very different from undergrad and a PhD even more so (talk more about this below).\nAt the end of the day however, the heavy time and emotional commitment of a PhD program is no\nlonger something I am interested in.\n\nDoes this mean that my past one and half years of Masters is wasted? 100 percent not. I was able to meet\nsome amazing people, work on some super cool projects and travel to a bunch of places across the U.S. If I had the option to do it all over again, I would still choose to pursue my degree.\n\n# Research\nOne interesting difference between graduate school (PhD even more so than masters) compared to undergrad is \nthe difference in duties and routine. For an undergraduate student, almost all of your time is spent on learning, which\nis basically repeating or doing things that others have already done. For a grad student, a lot of time is now spent on\nexploring new directions and trying out new things. Your classes also reflect that. Many graduate classes are now seminar style\nclasses that feature papers on state-of-the-art work that inspire students to work on new research projects. These classes\nare also almost all extremely bird, in order to make more time for research. \n\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/UIUC_two.jpg\" alt=\"Sublime's custom image\"/\u003e\n  \u003cem\u003eGoing to SF to Give Talk on Undergraduate Research\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\nDuring my time at UIUC, I did work on a few really cool projects and really have to thank my advisor([Lingming Zhang](https://lingming.cs.illinois.edu/index.html)) and PhD mentors ([Jiawei](https://jw-liu.xyz//) and [Steven](https://steven.cs.illinois.edu/)) for their support. In the end tho, I realized this isn't the direction for me (due to reasons mentioned above) but is definetly something I might want to revisit in the future (hopefully not when I am too old tho).\n\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/UIUC_four.jpg\" alt=\"Sublime's custom image\"/\u003e\n  \u003cem\u003eNot a lot of people showed up :(, still fun tho\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n# Fun \u0026 WLB\nI definetly had a great work life balance in school, especially for a graudate \nstudent. Like previously mentioned, graduate classes are almost all extremely bird and after securing my job and internship, the rest\nof my time is almost entirely spent between doing fun things and research (I didn't do that much research üôÉ). I got to travel to a bunch of places, meet a lot of cool people and play way too much League (my hands hurt). As a student in a college town, meeting new people and making friends is still definetly convinent, the loneliness of adulthood is definetly something I am not looking forward to.\n\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/UIUC_three.jpg\" alt=\"Sublime's custom image\"/\u003e\n  \u003cem\u003eTrip to New York During Spring Break\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n# What's Next\nAfter graduating, I will be working as a Software Engineer at Databricks in Bellevue.

Through this writing, I hope\n\u003e to share some insights on my personal graduate school admission\n\u003e journey and some of my personal learnings along the way.\n## Background\n\nI first began seriously thinking about graduate school during\nmy third (junior) year. I had been working with a professor\non some research projects for about a year at that point and was\ninterested in venturing deeper into academia. At the start of my senior year, \nI decided to apply to nine schools in total for Computer Science\nMasters programs. \n\nIn the end, I was accepted to four schools: Berkeley, UIUC,\n Columbia and Michigan. Among these four choices, I decided \n to accept the offer from UIUC. In the rest of the post,\n I will summarize my application process and the learnings\n I made along the way.\n\n## Motivation\nA critical part of succeeding in higher education involves\nhaving strong motivation. Even in high school, the idea of \nsenioritis already plagues students. In college, the mentality\nof C's gets degrees is even stronger. Combined with the increase\nin difficulty and courseload, it is easy to lose focus. At times,\nyou would have to make some sacrifices in your personal life to\nperform better academically.\n\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/gradschool_2.jpg\" alt=\"It be like that\"/\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\nTherefore an important lesson I learned is having a strong\nmotivation behind attending graduate school. The process of\napplying to graduate schools start well ahead of senior year\nand brings many unforseen challenges along the way. \n\nFinally, graduate admissions is only a very small part\nof the graduate school experience. If a student does not have\nthe motivation to even go through the appliation process, they\nlikily would not have the motivation to push through during\nthe real hardships of graduate school.\n\n## Masters vs Ph.D. Programs\nUnlike the rest of the world, Masters programs in the United States usually\naim to prepare students for the workforce and the amount\nof funding opportunities available is also very limited. In other\ncountries such as Canada, many Masters programs are thesis based\nand offer full funding in order to prepare students for a career\nin academia. Among the nine schools I applied four, only two of\nthe nine programs can be considered as fully researched based \nprograms (UIUC and Princeton). \n\nTherefore, if you are interested in research and academia. One\noption is to directly apply for Ph.D. programs without getting\na Masters. In fact, in the United States, Ph.D. students typically\nobtain their masters during the first two years of their Ph.D.\neducation. Here are links to additional information on this by\nProfessor Shriram Krishnamurthi\n\n- [Difference Between Masters and Ph.D.](https://parentheticallyspeaking.org/articles/us-cs-phd-faq/#%28part._.What_s_the_difference_between_a_master_s_and_a_.Ph.D_%29)\n- [How CS Masters Funding Works](https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Memos/Funding-CS-Grad-School/)\n\n## School Ranking and Selection\nWhen it comes to higher education, rankings inevitably makes its way\ninto every student's decision. After doing a simple Google Search,\nstudents can probably find every ranking system under the sun that\nlooks at different Universities and programs in a thousand different\nways. I would be lying if I said I did not factor school ranking\ninto my final decision. Here are some ranking websites I looked at while\napplying for programs.\n\n- [CS Ranking](https://csrankings.org/#/index?all\u0026us)\n- [US News Report](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/computer-science-rankings)\n\nHowever, it is important to state that rankings should have a relatively\nlow priority when it comes to making the final decision. Factors such as\nadvisor, opportunity, location and costs should all play a major role \nin the final decision making. At the end of the day, I am the one going \nthrough graduate school. While going to a higher ranking school can\nopen doors, I am not going to graduate schools to impress others but rather\nfor the reasons in the next section. \n\n## Is graduate school something for me?\nDuring my undergraduate studies and internships, almost everyone around me\ndiscouraged me from persuing a Masters without having a strong intention of\ncontinuing to a Ph.D. I personally believe this sentiment is sensible.\nFor most tech jobs, having a Bachelor degree is usually more than enough \n(there are plenty of code camp developers who write awesome code).\n\nHowever for me personally, there were three main reasons that I decided to\ncontinue into graduate school.\n\n1. Exploration: I felt that there were many areas of Computer Science\nthat I did not fully explore during my undergrad\n\n2. Experience Academia: While this cannot be fully achieved with a U.S. Masters,\nI want to figure out whether I wish to persue a Ph.D. in the future\n\n3. Open More Opportunities: While a Masters do not have a major effect in most cases,\nthey can still open more oppurtunities in the future.\n\n\n\n\u003e [!abstract] Final Thoughts\n\u003e \n\u003e As a developer, I probably have decades of work ahead of me.\n\u003e Given my personality, I would probably get bored of it in a \n\u003e few years. Before then, I might as well take a detour and \n\u003e experience something new. At the end of the day, it is only\n\u003e two years of my life.\n\n","lastmodified":"2025-05-25T06:56:39.577979323Z","tags":["Writing"]},"/notes/2024/InTheEra":{"title":"Trying to Understand \"In the Era\" Hype In the Era of 2024 Research","content":"\n\u003e [!Warning] Views are My Own\n\u003e \n\u003e I am not an experienced researcher in any capacity.\n\u003e These are just some personal thoughts.
