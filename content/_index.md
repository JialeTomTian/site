## About Me
👋🏻 My name is Tom Tian. I am a full time Software Engineer at Databricks 🧱. I
completed my Masters of Science in
Computer Science (MSCS) at
the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign 🌽 and my Bachelor of Computer Science at the University
of Waterloo 🇨🇦. 


During school, my research interests generally lie in the application of Large Language Models for code reasoning, understanding and generation (I am still very intersted in this direction, so feel free to reach out to me regarding any opportunities in this area). You can reach out to me
using the links at the bottom of this page. You can also find
a link to my (probably outdated) resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QUxd1mMWFiDTKF6x-2WaU_7Rvfdoxnvj/view?usp=sharing).

## About This Page
I suck at free form writing. For the past few years, I have only written technical papers and documents.
This website is my best attempt to improve my free form writing. 
Maybe putting my ideas on the internet will motivate me to journal more 🤡. 
I hope 
to use this website as a way to frequently journal
my ideas and improve my writing skills during the process.
I don't expect anyone to actually read my entries but just
thought that using a basic web template would make the process
a lot more <em>fun</em>.
