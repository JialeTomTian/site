## About This Page
For a native English speaker, I suck at writing. 
Even when it comes to basic tasks such as 
creating pull requests and sending text messages
, I struggle to come up with coherent sentences that express
my ideas. In fact, just writing this paragraph took me half an hour 🤡. 
This website is my best attempt to improve my writing. I hope 
to use this website as a way to frequently journal
my ideas and improve my writing skills during the process.
I don't expect anyone to actually read my entries but just
thought that using a basic web template would make the process
a lot more <em>fun</em>.

## About Me
