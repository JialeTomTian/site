Just from reading the title, you probably already know what is coming.
*In the era of large language models* is now a phrase seen everywhere in 
2024 Computer Science research. 

During the ~2ish years, I have listened to many talks and read many 
papers on research in Software Engineering, Systems, Natural Language Processing
 and other Computer Science disciplines at large. One obvious trend is the 
 rise of large language models and its many other related topics (i.e. Agents, RLHF, multimodal etc.).
 Personally, I am very interested in this area and some of my recent research
 projects have directly touched these things. The work done by my research group
 and advisor has also been incredible and is drastically changing the 
 Software Engineering space for the better. However in general, I am curious
 whether this hype is justified and if this *in the era of x* idea promote
 lazy and low quality research.

I guess time will tell ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
