## Background & Disclaimer
I am by no means an expert on graduate school admissions and
this post is not meant to provide a complete a guide on how
the admission process works. Through this writing, I hope
to share some insights on my personal graduate school admission
journey and some of my personal learnings along the way.

I first began seriously thinking about graduate school during
my third (junior) year. I had been working with a professor
on some research projects for about a year at that point was
interested in venturing deeper into academia. In the end, I
decided to apply to nine schools in total for Computer Science
Masters programs. 

In the end, I was accepted to four schools: Berkeley, UIUC,
 Columbia and Michigan. Among these four choices, I decided 
 to accept the offer from UIUC. In the rest of the post,
 I will summarize my application process and the learnings
 I made along the way.

## Motivation
A critical part of succeeding in higher education involves
having strong motivation. Even in high school, the idea of 
senioritis already plagues students. In college, the mentality
of C's gets degrees is even stronger. Combined with the increase
in difficulty and courseload, it is easy to lose focus. At times,
you would have to make some sacrifices in your personal life to
perform better academically.

Therefore an important lesson I learned is having a strong
motivation behind attending graduate school. The process of
applying to graduate schools start well ahead of senior year
and brings many unforseen challenges along the way.
