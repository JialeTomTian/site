I love summers. Despite having many mannerism of your sterotypical CS student, I still love the great weather and being outdoors. I think my past ten years in Canada definetly made me appreciate summers a lot more. I love the long days, green vistas and general liveliness. Especially in Washington, where the weather strikes a perfect balance between cold and hot (unlike Toronto where it is somehow scorching hot in the summer despite being freezing cold in the winter). The only downside to this amazing season is that it makes the winters somehow even more unbearable.

Now that I am working full time, here's to a summer fulfilling summer where I get to fully take advantage of what Washington has to offer. (Gonna take a lot more time off work, hope my manager isn't reading this :D)
