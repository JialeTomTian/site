When I was younger, I always thought adulting was trivial. Even during college, I did not fully understand how folks could struggle with juggling
finances, appointments and everyday problems. As I start working full time now, I finally understand just how much BS there is in the real world. At this point, I think this realization must be a rite of passage for any oblivious 20-something year old entering the real world.

From moving to a new city to buying my first car to filing my *\(surprisingly complicated\)* tax returns, the past few months made me appreciate how great my parents are at being functional adults (a future dream for me too). But hey, the freedom with being an adult is nice too.

While writing this note, I just realized I needed to pay some bills... 

Here is a picture of my new car (Bold color I know):
