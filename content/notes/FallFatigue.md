Every year during the fall, I go into hibernation for at least two weeks.
This usually happens during before or after halloween and has 
happened every year since I went into highschool.
I think the term for this is called fall fatigue.

> Fall Fatigue[!note]
> -  a sense of tiredness and low energy that many people experience as the season changes
> - kicks Tom's ass every year
> - ruins Toms productivity when he has a thesis due very soon

To anyone else suffering, drink plenty of water, get lots of rest
and use this as an excuse to procrastinate on your important work.
