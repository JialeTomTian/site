## Background
Over the past four years, I have been in a constant cycle 
of co-op and school terms. The longest break I had was about
three weeks off last year in the summer. But even during that
time, I spent a good portion of my break finishing up my
undergraduate research and thesis. e, something
always occupied my mind. From assignments to jobs to graduate
admissions, I always focused on a goal.

During this period, I was so tunnel visoned on my goals
that I never stopped to put my life into perspective, never really stopped and thought about why I really
pursued my goals. 

After finishing my final exam in April, all of this stopped. I had no major obligations
and all my work stopped. However, even during this time,
I failed to take a step back and figure out the
 motivation behind my goals.

## Environment
Without ever realizing it, I fell into the trap of 
sinking into my surroundings. During my time at
University, most people around me are 
in the same major. My roommates study in the same 
major, the people in my classes study the same major
and I mostly hang out with people in the same major.
Naturally, I began focusing on the same goals that peers
had: passing classes and getting internships. 

At the same time, at home, my parents were constantly 
reminding me the importance of grad school. While I 
already had some initial interest in pursuing graduate
school, this pushed me to put most of my energy 
towards graduate school applications, which were
both time consuming and stress inducing. I talk more
about that [here](/notes/GradSchool.md).

To break out of this cycle of mindless work and endless
goal chasing. I needed to change up my environment and 
change up my perspective.
