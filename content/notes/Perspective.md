## Background
Over the past four years, I have been in a constant cycle 
of co-op and school terms. The longest break I had was about
three weeks off last year in the summer. But even during that
time, I spent a good portion of my break finishing up my
undergraduate research and thesis. During this time, something
always occupied my mind. From assignments to jobs to graduate
admissions, I always focused on a goal.

After finishing my final exam in April, all of this stopped. I had no major obligations
and all my work stopped. At first, all of this freedom felt strange.
During school, all I wished for was a break to persue personal interests.
But with so much free time, I felt lost and spent much of my time 
watching shows and playing video games. However, at the same time, I also
had the opportunity to persue some hobbies and catch with many of my friends
outside of University.

Got back into TFT and hit diamond. Not a proud accomplishment ðŸ˜‚.

Through this month long (so far) break, I finally took a step back
and gained some **perspective**.
