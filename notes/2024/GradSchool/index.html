this post is not meant to provide a complete a guide on how
the admission process works. Through this writing, I hope
to share some insights on my personal graduate school admission
journey and some of my personal learnings along the way.</p></blockquote><a href=#background><h2 id=background><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Background</h2></a><p>I first began seriously thinking about graduate school during
my third (junior) year. I had been working with a professor
on some research projects for about a year at that point and was
interested in venturing deeper into academia. At the start of my senior year,
I decided to apply to nine schools in total for Computer Science
Masters programs.</p><p>In the end, I was accepted to four schools: Berkeley, UIUC,
Columbia and Michigan. Among these four choices, I decided
to accept the offer from UIUC. In the rest of the post,
I will summarize my application process and the learnings
I made along the way.</p><a href=#motivation><h2 id=motivation><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Motivation</h2></a><p>A critical part of succeeding in higher education involves
having strong motivation. Even in high school, the idea of
senioritis already plagues students. In college, the mentality
of C&rsquo;s gets degrees is even stronger. Combined with the increase
in difficulty and courseload, it is easy to lose focus. At times,
you would have to make some sacrifices in your personal life to
perform better academically.</p><p align=center><img src=/notes/images/gradschool_2.jpg alt="It be like that"></p><p>Therefore an important lesson I learned is having a strong
motivation behind attending graduate school. The process of
applying to graduate schools start well ahead of senior year
and brings many unforseen challenges along the way.</p><p>Finally, graduate admissions is only a very small part
of the graduate school experience. If a student does not have
the motivation to even go through the appliation process, they
likily would not have the motivation to push through during
the real hardships of graduate school.</p><a href=#masters-vs-phd-programs><h2 id=masters-vs-phd-programs><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Masters vs Ph.D. Programs</h2></a><p>Unlike the rest of the world, Masters programs in the United States usually
aim to prepare students for the workforce and the amount
of funding opportunities available is also very limited. In other
countries such as Canada, many Masters programs are thesis based
and offer full funding in order to prepare students for a career
in academia. Among the nine schools I applied four, only two of
the nine programs can be considered as fully researched based
programs (UIUC and Princeton).</p><p>Therefore, if you are interested in research and academia. One
option is to directly apply for Ph.D. programs without getting
a Masters. In fact, in the United States, Ph.D. students typically
obtain their masters during the first two years of their Ph.D.
education. Here are links to additional information on this by
Professor Shriram Krishnamurthi</p><ul><li><a href=https://parentheticallyspeaking.org/articles/us-cs-phd-faq/#%28part._.What_s_the_difference_between_a_master_s_and_a_.Ph.D_%29 rel=noopener>Difference Between Masters and Ph.D.</a></li><li><a href=https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Memos/Funding-CS-Grad-School/ rel=noopener>How CS Masters Funding Works</a></li></ul><a href=#school-ranking-and-selection><h2 id=school-ranking-and-selection><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>School Ranking and Selection</h2></a><p>When it comes to higher education, rankings inevitably makes its way
into every student&rsquo;s decision. After doing a simple Google Search,
students can probably find every ranking system under the sun that
looks at different Universities and programs in a thousand different
ways. I would be lying if I said I did not factor school ranking
into my final decision. Here are some ranking websites I looked at while
applying for programs.</p><ul><li><a href=https://csrankings.org/#/index?all&us rel=noopener>CS Ranking</a></li><li><a href=https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/computer-science-rankings rel=noopener>US News Report</a></li></ul><p>However, it is important to state that rankings should have a relatively
low priority when it comes to making the final decision. Factors such as
advisor, opportunity, location and costs should all play a major role
in the final decision making. At the end of the day, I am the one going
through graduate school. While going to a higher ranking school can
open doors, I am not going to graduate schools to impress others but rather
for the reasons in the next section.</p><a href=#is-graduate-school-something-for-me><h2 id=is-graduate-school-something-for-me><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Is graduate school something for me?</h2></a><p>During my undergraduate studies and internships, almost everyone around me
discouraged me from persuing a Masters without having a strong intention of
continuing to a Ph.D. I personally believe this sentiment is sensible.
For most tech jobs, having a Bachelor degree is usually more than enough
(there are plenty of code camp developers who write awesome code).</p><p>However for me personally, there were three main reasons that I decided to
continue into graduate school.</p><ol><li><p>Exploration: I felt that there were many areas of Computer Science
that I did not fully explore during my undergrad</p></li><li><p>Experience Academia: While this cannot be fully achieved with a U.S. Masters,
I want to figure out whether I wish to persue a Ph.D. in the future</p></li><li><p>Open More Opportunities: While a Masters do not have a major effect in most cases,
they can still open more oppurtunities in the future.</p></li></ol><blockquote class=abstract-callout><p>Final Thoughts</p><p>As a developer, I probably have decades of work ahead of me.
Given my personality, I would probably get bored of it in a
few years. Before then, I might as well take a detour and
experience something new. At the end of the day, it is only
two years of my life.</p></blockquote></article><hr><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Tom Tian using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, Â© 2025</p><ul><li><a href=https://www.jialetomtian.com/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/j63tian/>LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/JialeTomTian>GitHub</a></li><li><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7NmzZnQAAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
